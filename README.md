# Plant Monitor - Frontend

## Project Description

**Plant Monitor** is an application designed for monitoring environmental conditions to help take care of plants. It tracks parameters such as temperature and humidity, and can automatically control devices like air humidifiers based on the current conditions.

The frontend application "Plant Monitor" provides a user interface for displaying plant condition data and controlling device settings (e.g., humidifiers). The frontend communicates with the backend API, which collects sensor data and manages the devices within the system.
